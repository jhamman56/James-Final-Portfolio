## Left_Trim process for Lucy UI
Developed a custom function "left_trim" for Lucy UI - a platform that provides logging solutions to internal clients to monitor and maintain their own applications and processes
- This function will be used by other engineers concerned with dev-ops, code maintenance, and other SDR-type roles, who require quick, efficient, and easy-to-implement logging solutions for their applications
- The function acts as a utility to editing action to create a process in Lucy UI that can delete blank spaces in front of a string, thereby preventing unnecessary formatting and data entry errors
- I was assigned to create it for my team so that members of my team could implement this in their own functions for greater efficiency and effectiveness
- The most important feature is the process itself that can be implemented seamleassly in other people's code in order to give more ease to other engineers
